# Language code lookup

This tool looks up a language code and checks whether it is enabled
and can be used on MediaWiki sites, what the localization status is
for various relevant message groups, and which Wikimedia sites exist
in that language.

It is running on Toolforge at
[https://codelookup.toolforge.org/](https://codelookup.toolforge.org/).

The tool is inspired by and backwards-engineered from SPQRobin's
[Codelookup](https://robin.toolforge.org/?tool=codelookup) tool,
which stopped working some time in late 2021/early 2022, but with some
added functionality.
